I will outline the UK National Curriculum expectations for mental arithmetic from Reception to Year 6, covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and squaring. For each year group, I will provide detailed examples of sums that children would be expected to solve mentally. I'll update you once the research is complete.

# Age-Related Expectations for Mental Arithmetic (Reception to Year 6)

Below is a breakdown of what children are expected to do **mentally** in arithmetic at each primary year group, aligned with the UK National Curriculum. The expectations are organized by year group and by operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and squaring). Each section describes the difficulty level of mental calculations and gives example sums that a child at that stage should handle mentally.

## Reception (Age 4–5)

**Addition:** Children begin combining small quantities. They learn to add two single-digit numbers using objects or counting on, with totals usually up to 10. The focus is on practical scenarios (e.g. adding groups of objects) rather than formal notation ([EYFS | Hunnyhill](https://www.hunnyhillschool.co.uk/eyfs#:~:text=Numbers%3A%20children%20count%20reliably%20with,including%20doubling%2C%20halving%20and%20sharing)).
*Examples (solved mentally at Reception level):*
- 2 + 3 = 5
- 4 + 1 = 5
- 5 + 5 = 10 (using fingers or objects to count)

**Subtraction:** At this stage, subtraction is understood as “taking away” from a small group. Children subtract one single-digit number from another by counting back, with results between 0 and 10 ([EYFS | Hunnyhill](https://www.hunnyhillschool.co.uk/eyfs#:~:text=Numbers%3A%20children%20count%20reliably%20with,including%20doubling%2C%20halving%20and%20sharing)). They practice in practical contexts (e.g. eating 2 of 5 apples to see 3 are left).
*Examples:*
- 5 − 2 = 3
- 8 − 3 = 5
- 6 − 6 = 0

**Multiplication:** Formal multiplication isn’t taught in Reception. Instead, children explore **doubling** as an introduction to multiplication ([EYFS | Hunnyhill](https://www.hunnyhillschool.co.uk/eyfs#:~:text=Numbers%3A%20children%20count%20reliably%20with,including%20doubling%2C%20halving%20and%20sharing)). Doubling a small number (adding it to itself) is a typical activity (e.g. double 3 is 6). They also experiment with grouping (sharing objects equally) which lays groundwork for multiplication/division.
*Examples:*
- “Double 2” (2 + 2) = 4
- “Double 5” (5 + 5) = 10
- Combine 3 groups of 2 objects (2 + 2 + 2 = 6)

**Division:** Formal division is not expected. Children instead learn **halving** and simple sharing ([EYFS | Hunnyhill](https://www.hunnyhillschool.co.uk/eyfs#:~:text=Numbers%3A%20children%20count%20reliably%20with,including%20doubling%2C%20halving%20and%20sharing)). They find half of a small even number by splitting objects into two equal groups. This is done with concrete items, but they should recognize, for example, that half of 6 is 3.
*Examples:*
- Share 4 cookies between 2 children: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 each
- Half of 8 = 4 (since 4 + 4 makes 8)
- Split 6 apples into 2 equal baskets: 6 ÷ 2 = 3

**Squaring:** The concept of square numbers is *not introduced* in Reception. While children might notice “double” patterns (like 2 + 2 or 3 + 3), they do not yet learn squaring (number × itself). There are no formal expectations for squaring at this age.

## Year 1 (Age 5–6)

**Addition:** In Year 1, children should mentally add small numbers with sums up to 20. They rely on number bonds (pairs that make 10 or 20) and counting on. For example, they know combinations that make 10 (e.g. 7 + 3) and use these to add teen numbers (e.g. 10 + 5) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,7%20%3D%20%3F%20%E2%88%92%209)). They typically add a one-digit number to another one-digit or to a teen number, sometimes using counters or fingers initially but moving toward mental methods.
*Examples:*
- 6 + 2 = 8
- 7 + 3 = 10 (number bond to 10)
- 13 + 6 = 19

**Subtraction:** Year 1 children subtract numbers within 20 mentally. They use knowledge of number bonds and count back in ones. They understand subtraction as finding “how many left” or “the difference” ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,7%20%3D%20%3F%20%E2%88%92%209)). Typically, they subtract a one-digit number from another number up to 20.
*Examples:*
- 9 − 4 = 5
- 15 − 5 = 10
- 18 − 7 = 11

**Multiplication:** Formal multiplication is introduced in simple terms. Children solve one-step problems involving **multiplying by 2, 5, or 10 in practical contexts** (often with teacher support) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20should%20be%20taught%20to%3A)). This is usually done through repeated addition or using arrays of objects. They begin to count in 2s, 5s, and 10s which helps lay the foundation for times tables ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20should%20be%20taught%20to%3A)). A key focus is also on **doubling** small numbers mentally (which is multiplying by 2).
*Examples:*
- Count 2, 4, 6, 8 (counting in twos, e.g. 4 = 2×2)
- 5 + 5 = 10 (doubling 5, equivalent to 2 × 5)
- 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 (three groups of 2, a precursor to 3 × 2)

**Division:** In Year 1, division is approached as **sharing** or **halving** in one-step problems ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20should%20be%20taught%20to%3A)). Children might solve problems like sharing 10 sweets between 2 friends (each gets 5). They learn the idea of equal groups through practical activities. Halving simple even numbers up to 20 is the main expectation (inverse of doubling).
*Examples:*
- 10 shared between 2 = 5 each (10 ÷ 2 = 5)
- Half of 8 = 4
- Divide 6 apples into 2 baskets: 6 ÷ 2 = 3

**Squaring:** Not taught in Year 1. Children are not expected to understand square numbers yet. (They might compute **2 × 2 = 4** or **3 × 3 = 9** if it comes up, but this would be incidental. The formal concept of “squaring” is introduced in later years.)

## Year 2 (Age 6–7)

**Addition:** By the end of Year 2, children should **know all addition facts up to 20 fluently** (e.g. 9+7=16) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,pictorial%20representations%2C%20and%20mentally%2C%20including)). They use those facts to derive related sums up to 100 ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,pictorial%20representations%2C%20and%20mentally%2C%20including)). This means if they know 3+7=10, they can reason that 30+70=100 ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20practise%20addition%20and%20subtraction,commutativity%20and%20associativity%20of%20addition)). Mentally, they can add a two-digit number and a one-digit or tens number without needing written methods ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,digit%20numbers)). Difficulty level includes bridging through 10s (e.g. 8+7 involves passing 10) and adding two two-digit numbers that total within 100 using strategies.
*Examples:*
- 8 + 7 = 15 (uses known facts within 20)
- 45 + 5 = 50 (adding a one-digit to a two-digit)
- 60 + 40 = 100 (derived from 6+4=10 to make 100)

**Subtraction:** In Year 2, children also **know subtraction facts within 20** and use them to derive others up to 100 ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,pictorial%20representations%2C%20and%20mentally%2C%20including)). They can mentally subtract a single-digit or a multiple of 10 from a two-digit number. They understand the inverse relationship with addition (e.g. if 7+3=10 then 10−3=7) to help reason out differences ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,and%20solve%20missing%20number%20problems)). The difficulty level includes subtracting across a ten (e.g. 13−5, possibly done by recalling 5+8=13).
*Examples:*
- 15 − 7 = 8 (uses a known fact within 20)
- 50 − 20 = 30 (subtracting a multiple of ten)
- 100 − 30 = 70 (uses knowledge that 30+70=100)

**Multiplication:** By the end of Year 2, children **recall the 2, 5, and 10 times tables and related division facts** confidently ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,methods%2C%20and%20multiplication%20and%20division)). They can perform simple multiplications mentally when the numbers are drawn from those tables. For example, they should instantly know 5 × 2 = 10 or 5 × 5 = 25. They also learn that multiplication is commutative (e.g. 2 × 5 = 5 × 2) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=and%20equals%20%28%3D%29%20signs%20,methods%2C%20and%20multiplication%20and%20division)). Mental multiplication beyond these tables (like 3 × 4) is emerging but not yet required by the curriculum in Year 2.
*Examples:*
- 5 × 2 = 10
- 5 × 5 = 25
- 10 × 3 = 30

**Division:** Year 2 students divide using the facts from the 2, 5, and 10 tables. They should recognize division as the inverse of multiplication for these facts ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,methods%2C%20and%20multiplication%20and%20division)). For instance, knowing 5 × 2 = 10 means they know 10 ÷ 2 = 5. They solve simple division problems mentally, especially if they map to familiar table facts or involve halving (for ÷2) and dividing by 10. They also learn that division is not commutative (order matters) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=and%20equals%20%28%3D%29%20signs%20,methods%2C%20and%20multiplication%20and%20division)).
*Examples:*
- 10 ÷ 5 = 2
- 12 ÷ 2 = 6
- 20 ÷ 10 = 2

**Squaring:** The concept of squaring is *still not formally taught* in Year 2. Children might encounter cases like 2×2 or 5×5 through multiplication practice, but they won’t yet be asked to identify “square numbers.” For example, they will learn **2 × 2 = 4** and **5 × 5 = 25**, but these are treated as general multiplication facts, not a separate squaring topic.

## Year 3 (Age 7–8)

**Addition:** In Year 3, mental addition and subtraction skills advance to larger numbers. Children are expected to **add numbers in the hundreds mentally**, such as a three-digit number plus ones, tens, or hundreds ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20should%20be%20taught%20to%3A)). They continue to use place value strategies and number bonds. For example, they can calculate 326 + 40 or 326 + 7 in their heads by focusing on the tens or ones place. Two-digit additions that cross 100 (like 55 + 47 = 102) are practiced so they become comfortable when sums exceed 100 ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20practise%20solving%20varied%20addition,the%20answers%20could%20exceed%20100)).
*Examples:*
- 234 + 5 = 239 (add ones to a three-digit number)
- 170 + 30 = 200 (add tens, bridging to the next hundred)
- 325 + 300 = 625 (add hundreds to a three-digit number)

**Subtraction:** Similarly, Year 3 children subtract in their heads with three-digit numbers minus ones, tens, or hundreds ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20should%20be%20taught%20to%3A)). For example, they find 432 − 30 by subtracting the tens. They use estimation and inverse operations to check results (e.g. check 432−30 by adding 30 back) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,more%20complex%20addition%20and%20subtraction)). They also handle two-digit subtractions that may cross 100 (e.g. 102 − 47) by applying strategies like counting up or adjusting.
*Examples:*
- 256 − 6 = 250 (subtract ones)
- 340 − 40 = 300 (subtract tens)
- 500 − 200 = 300 (subtract hundreds)

**Multiplication:** By Year 3, children **memorize the 3, 4, and 8 times tables**, on top of the 2, 5, 10 from earlier ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,are%20connected%20to%20m%20objects)). They should recall these facts quickly in mental math. This means they can answer questions like 4 × 7 or 8 × 6 from memory. They also start using these facts to multiply larger numbers by one digit. For example, to do 12 × 3 mentally, they might break it into 10×3 and 2×3 ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,are%20connected%20to%20m%20objects)). The understanding of commutativity (e.g. 4×7 = 7×4) helps them use whichever fact they remember first.
*Examples:*
- 3 × 6 = 18
- 4 × 8 = 32
- 12 × 3 = 36  (using the fact that 10×3=30 and 2×3=6)

**Division:** Year 3 students extend mental division to include facts from the 3, 4, and 8 tables. They should know, for instance, that 24 ÷ 8 = 3 and 32 ÷ 4 = 8 without needing to write it down. Division problems that go with the tables they’ve learned are expected to be done mentally (e.g. 27 ÷ 3, 16 ÷ 4). They also practice using the inverse relationship: since 8×4=32, they know 32÷4=8 ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=Pupils%20continue%20to%20practise%20their,4%20and%208%20multiplication%20tables)). Mental division may involve simple cases of two-digit numbers divided by one-digit (where it divides exactly).
*Examples:*
- 24 ÷ 3 = 8
- 32 ÷ 4 = 8
- 56 ÷ 8 = 7

**Squaring:** Squaring is *informally* within reach because students know some squares through their tables (e.g. 3 × 3 = 9, 4 × 4 = 16, 8 × 8 = 64). However, Year 3 does not explicitly teach the concept of “square numbers.” Children at this stage won’t be asked to list square numbers, but they can compute a few if needed through multiplication. (For example, they can find **5 × 5 = 25**, even though they might not call it “5 squared.”)

## Year 4 (Age 8–9)

**Addition:** Year 4 expects children to handle mental addition of larger numbers and to start dealing with simple decimals. They should know number pairs that total 100 reliably (for instance, 37 + 63) ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Derive%20addition%20and%20subtraction,to%20the%2012th%20multiple)) and use that to calculate complements to 1000 (e.g. 370 + 630 = 1000). They also begin to work with tenths in mental math – for example, knowing two decimals that sum to 1 (0.4 + 0.6 = 1.0) ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Recognise%20the%20place%20value,to%201%2C000%20and%20multiples%20of)). Overall, they can mentally add multiples of 1, 10, 100, or 0.1 to a number with confidence.
*Examples:*
- 45 + 55 = 100 (number bonds to 100)
- 600 + 400 = 1000 (number bonds to 1000 using hundreds)
- 0.7 + 0.3 = 1.0 (adding decimals to make a whole)

**Subtraction:** In Year 4, children can mentally subtract multiples of 1, 10, or 100 from four-digit numbers. They use their knowledge of complements to 100/1000 in reverse (e.g. 100 − 45 = 55) ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Derive%20addition%20and%20subtraction,to%20the%2012th%20multiple)). They also handle simple decimal subtractions, such as subtracting a tenth from a whole number (1.0 − 0.4 = 0.6). Rounding skills help them estimate and adjust when subtracting awkward numbers (for example, subtract 99 by subtracting 100 and adding 1 back) ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=and%20find%20the%20corresponding%20halves,inverse%20operations%20to%20check%20Y5)).
*Examples:*
- 100 − 45 = 55
- 750 − 50 = 700
- 2.0 − 0.5 = 1.5

**Multiplication:** A major Year 4 milestone is to **know all multiplication facts up to 12 × 12** and the corresponding divisions by heart ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,by%201%20digit%2C%20integer%20scaling)). By the end of Year 4, children should be *fluent* in all times tables (2–12). This means any single-digit multiplication (and its reverse division) can be answered mentally, e.g. 7×8=56, 9×7=63. They also apply these facts in mental strategies: understanding the effect of multiplying by 0 or 1, and using factor pairs (e.g. to compute 6×4×5, they might do 6×5=30 then 30×4=120) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,by%201%20digit%2C%20integer%20scaling)). They can double any two-digit number in their head (which is 2× that number) ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Understand%20the%20effect%20of,digit%20numbers)).
*Examples:*
- 7 × 8 = 56
- 12 × 12 = 144
- 9 × 0 = 0 (multiplying by zero)

**Division:** With mastery of tables to 12×12, Year 4 students can mentally divide using those facts. They recognize **factor pairs** for numbers (e.g. factors of 48 are 6 and 8, so 48 ÷ 6 = 8) ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,are%20connected%20to%20m%20objects)). They comfortably handle divisions like 81 ÷ 9 = 9 or 72 ÷ 8 = 9 in their heads. They also know dividing by 1 leaves a number unchanged, and that you cannot change the order in division. Mental division might also involve splitting a problem (for example, to divide 96 by 8, they might think 80÷8 and 16÷8 then add results).
*Examples:*
- 72 ÷ 8 = 9
- 36 ÷ 6 = 6
- 81 ÷ 9 = 9

**Squaring:** The term “square number” may still not be formally emphasized in Year 4, but practically students have encountered all squares up to 12² through their times tables (1×1, 2×2, ..., 12×12). They can compute these products mentally. For instance, they will know **6 × 6 = 36** and **11 × 11 = 121** as part of multiplication fluency. Recognizing these as “square numbers” (and the notation $n^2$) will be a target in the next year, but Year 4 students already have the ability to find a square by multiplication if needed.

## Year 5 (Age 9–10)

**Addition:** In Year 5, children work with larger integers and decimals in mental calculations. They practice adding numbers with four or more digits in their head by using place value knowledge (e.g. 6,000 + 700 = 6,700) and simplifying strategies. They also add decimals mentally, especially one- or two-decimal-place numbers that sum to whole numbers (for example, knowing 0.75 + 0.25 = 1) ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Round%20decimal%20numbers%20with,for%20multiplication%20tables%20up%20to)). The difficulty level now includes combining numbers like **10,000 + 2,500** or **5.7 + 3.3** mentally by breaking them into manageable parts.
*Examples:*
- 2,500 + 4,700 = 7,200
- 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0
- 7.5 + 2.5 = 10.0

**Subtraction:** Year 5 students subtract large numbers and decimals in their heads. They might do this by rounding and compensating (e.g. to compute 12,462 − 2,300 mentally, they recognize the answer as 10,162 ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=They%20practise%20mental%20calculations%20with,12%2C462%20%E2%80%93%202%2C300%20%3D%2010%2C162))). They find differences involving thousands (like 15,000 − 6,500) and subtract decimals (like 5.0 − 1.3 = 3.7) mentally. They are encouraged to *estimate* and then adjust, using inverse operations to check ([

This means the mental difficulty includes keeping track of multiple steps.
*Examples:*
- 10,000 − 2,500 = 7,500
- 5 − 2.8 = 2.2
- 12,462 − 2,300 = 10,162 ([

**Multiplication:** By Year 5, children have all basic multiplication facts at their fingertips, and they extend this knowledge to more complex mental multiplication. They should **recognize and use square numbers and cube numbers, and the notation ² and ³** ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK

They also multiply and divide whole numbers and decimals by 10, 100, and 1,000 mentally (e.g. knowing 3.5 × 10 = 35) ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Derive%20all%20square%20numbers,and%20decimal%20numbers%20with)). Mental strategies include using factors (e.g. to multiply by 25, multiply by 100 then divide by 4). The expected difficulty includes multiplying two-digit numbers by one-digit numbers in head (like 15 × 6) by breaking them down, and even multiplying two two-digit numbers with a friendly combination (like 20 × 15).
*Examples:*
- 15 × 6 = 90 (break into 10×6 + 5×6)
- 25 × 8 = 200 (since 25×4=100, then double)
- 3.2 × 10 = 32

**Division:** In Year 5, mental division involves larger dividends and leveraging number sense. Children find factor pairs and common factors to help divide (e.g. to do 144 ÷ 16, they know 16 = 8×2, so 144÷8=18 then 18÷2=9). They identify multiples and use that to simplify divisions. They are expected to find **all factor pairs of a number and common factors of two numbers** ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=12%20x%2012%20%EF%82%B7%20Find,factors%20for%20a%20pair%20of)), which helps in mental division. They also continue to use inverses: for example, to solve ⟮ ? × 12 = 132 ⟯ mentally, they do 132 ÷ 12. Dividing by 10, 100, 1,000 (including decimals) is done by place-value shifting ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Derive%20all%20square%20numbers,and%20decimal%20numbers%20with)).
*Examples:*
- 144 ÷ 12 = 12 (uses known square number fact)
- 96 ÷ 6 = 16 (since 6 × 16 = 96)
- 3.6 ÷ 10 = 0.36

**Squaring:** Year 5 formally introduces **square numbers**. Pupils learn to **recognise and use square numbers (and the squared symbol)** ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,and%20problems%20involving%20simple%20rates)). They are expected to know the squares of integers 1 through 12 by heart ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=numbers%3B%20identify%20multiples%20%EF%82%B7%20Derive,multiplying%2Fdividing%20whole%20numbers%2C%20and%20decimal)). The difficulty level here is memorization and quick recall of these specific products, and understanding that (for example) “$7^2$” means $7×7$. They might also solve simple problems involving squares (e.g. “What is the area of a 5 by 5 square?” implicitly uses $5^2$).
*Examples (known square numbers in Year 5):*
- $6^2 = 36$
- $9^2 = 81$
- $12^2 = 144$

## Year 6 (Age 10–11)

**Addition:** By Year 6, children are **fluent** in mental addition with large numbers and decimals. They can confidently add numbers in the thousands or more by breaking calculations into parts (e.g. 7,000 + 8,500 = 15,500) or using rounding strategies (e.g. $999 + 456$, treat 999 as 1,000 then adjust to get 1,455). They also add decimal numbers of varying lengths mentally, such as adding tenths and hundredths. The expectation is that they **undertake mental calculations with increasingly large and complex numbers** ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=appendix%201%20%28PDF%2C%20248KB%29%20%29)), choosing efficient methods (like compensating, partitioning, or using known sums).
*Examples:*
- 7,500 + 2,500 = 10,000
- 4.8 + 3.4 = 8.2
- 999 + 456 = 1,455 (using compensation: 1000+456−1)

**Subtraction:** Year 6 students perform mental subtraction on large numbers and decimals, often using multi-step strategies. They might subtract a near round number and adjust (e.g. subtract 5000 instead of 4997, then add back 3). They are expected to handle mixed operations mentally, so subtracting may be part of a multi-operation problem ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK

They also comfortably find differences with decimals (e.g. 13.5 − 2.7). Estimation is used to gauge whether answers are reasonable ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK

*Examples:*
- 10,000 − 4,500 = 5,500
- 5 − 1.4 = 3.6
- 1455 − 999 = 456  (thought of as 1455 − 1000 + 1)

**Multiplication:** By the end of primary school, children can deploy all their multiplication knowledge in mental math. They **recall all table facts through 12×12 effortlessly** ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Recall%20multiplication%2Fdivision%20facts%20for,BODMAS)) and use them in complex mental calculations. They can multiply multi-digit numbers in parts (for example, to multiply 36 × 4 in head: 30×4 + 6×4 = 144). They also handle combined operations mentally; for instance, calculating 50 × 7 + 24 quickly as part of a problem. Year 6 pupils understand and apply the **order of operations** (BODMAS/BIDMAS) in mental arithmetic when needed ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=method%20of%20short%20division%20where,methods%20to%20use%20and%20why)). Multiplying decimals by 10, 100, or 1,000 is second nature by now, and they can even mentally multiply two decimals in simple cases (like 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.1) by converting to fractions or using place value.
*Examples:*
- 12 × 12 = 144 (key fact still at their fingertips)
- 25 × 16 = 400 (using factors: 25×4=100, then ×4 again)
- 0.5 × 100 = 50

**Division:** In Year 6, mental division involves using all the techniques accumulated so far. Students identify primes, factors, and multiples which helps them simplify divisions ([
      National curriculum in England: mathematics programmes of study - GOV.UK
  ](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study#:~:text=,addition%2C%20subtraction%2C%20multiplication%20and%20division)) ([

They might break a division into steps (e.g. to find 360 ÷ 24, first do 360 ÷ 6 = 60, then 60 ÷ 4 = 15). They comfortably divide decimals by 10, 100, 1,000 mentally (shifting the decimal point). They also reason through problems with remainders or fractional results using mental estimation if an exact mental calculation isn’t straightforward. Essentially, they can perform division mentally when the division aligns with known facts or friendly numbers, even if the numbers are large.
*Examples:*
- 84 ÷ 7 = 12
- 360 ÷ 6 = 60
- 2.4 ÷ 100 = 0.024

**Squaring:** In Year 6, children **recall square numbers up to 12² with ease** ([Progression towards a standard written method of calculation](https://grange.southwark.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mental-Calculation-Strategies-Policy.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Recall%20multiplication%2Fdivision%20facts%20for,BODMAS)) and recognize them in various contexts. They know, for example, that 49, 64, 81 are square numbers (7², 8², 9²) and can identify a square number in a problem. This fluency is essentially a consolidation of Year 5 learning. Some may even explore squares beyond 12 (e.g. 13² = 169) out of interest, but the curriculum requirement is to confidently use squares up to $12^2$ and understand the concept of squaring a number ([

They also understand the relationship between square numbers and area (for example, a 10 by 10 square grid has 100 small squares).
*Examples:*
- $7^2 = 49$
- $10^2 = 100$
- $12^2 = 144$

Detailed Analysis of Mental Arithmetic Expectations for Years 7, 8, and 9
This section provides a comprehensive breakdown of mental arithmetic expectations for Key Stage 3, extending the detailed framework provided for Reception to Year 6. The analysis is based on the UK National Curriculum for Mathematics, educational resources, and typical progression in secondary education, focusing solely on mental calculations without pen and paper.
Background and Context
The UK National Curriculum for Key Stage 3 (Years 7 to 9) emphasizes developing fluency, mathematical reasoning, and problem-solving, building on the numerical capabilities from Key Stage 2. While specific mental arithmetic expectations are not as explicitly detailed as in primary years, the curriculum implies that students should consolidate and extend their mental calculation skills, particularly in the "Number" subdomain, which includes place value, ordering, operations, and working with decimals, fractions, and percentages. Resources from educational publishers and organizations, such as Schofield and Sims and Third Space Learning, provide insights into typical mental arithmetic practices, though most are primary-focused, requiring inference for secondary levels.
Methodology
Given the lack of direct National Curriculum specifications for mental arithmetic in Key Stage 3, this analysis infers expectations by:
Reviewing the provided breakdown for Years 1 to 6 to identify progression.

Examining Key Stage 3 curriculum content, such as understanding place value for decimals and integers, and operations with fractions and negative numbers.

Consulting educational resources and guidelines, such as those from the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM), to understand teaching strategies that imply mental arithmetic expectations.

Considering GCSE mathematics requirements, as Key Stage 3 prepares students for these, particularly the non-calculator paper, which relies heavily on mental arithmetic.

Detailed Expectations by Year Group
